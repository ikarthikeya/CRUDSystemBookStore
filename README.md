The following Spring framework project consists of basic endpoints to manage a book store's database system by performing the following operations.
These endpoints are developed to maintain the records:

1) /getAllBooks - This returns all the rows present in the H2 database
2) /getBookById/{id} - This URI returns a particular book details based on the ID
3) /addBook - I guess this does not require an explanation! :)
4) /updateBookById/{id} - Updates a specific record present in the database based on the ID
5) /deleteBookById/{id} - Yep, this is the last one.
